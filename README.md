## Automated Implementation Plan for OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation

This feature automates the creation of an implementation plan for integrating OpenAPI/Swagger documentation into your project. It analyzes your codebase, identifies potential integration points, and generates a prioritized, step-by-step plan to help you quickly and efficiently add OpenAPI specifications. This plan includes suggestions for:

*   Identifying existing APIs
*   Generating initial OpenAPI specifications from code comments or annotations
*   Setting up documentation hosting (e.g., Swagger UI)
*   Implementing automated documentation updates on code changes
*   Validating the generated OpenAPI specification

**Usage Examples:**

The implementation plan can be generated using the following command:

```bash
your-cli-tool generate-openapi-plan --project-path ./your-project --output-file openapi_plan.md
```

This command will analyze the project located at `./your-project` and output the implementation plan to a file named `openapi_plan.md`.

You can also specify a specific language or framework to tailor the plan:

```bash
your-cli-tool generate-openapi-plan --project-path ./your-project --language python --framework flask --output-file openapi_plan.md
```

This example generates a plan tailored for a Python project using the Flask framework.

To view the plan directly in your terminal, omit the `--output-file` option:

```bash
your-cli-tool generate-openapi-plan --project-path ./your-project
```

**Configuration Options:**

The `generate-openapi-plan` command supports the following configuration options:

*   `--project-path`:  (Required) The path to the root directory of your project.  Defaults to the current working directory if not specified.
*   `--language`: (Optional) The programming language used in your project (e.g., `python`, `java`, `javascript`).  This helps tailor the plan to language-specific tools and conventions. If omitted, the tool will attempt to automatically detect the language.
*   `--framework`: (Optional) The framework used in your project (e.g., `flask`, `spring`, `express`). This further refines the plan based on framework-specific documentation generation techniques. If omitted, the tool will attempt to automatically detect the framework.
*   `--output-file`: (Optional) The path to the file where the generated implementation plan will be written. If omitted, the plan will be printed to the console.
*   `--api-discovery`: (Optional)  Enable or disable automatic API discovery.  Defaults to `true`. If set to `false`, the plan will focus on setting up documentation hosting and validation.  Values: `true` or `false`.
*   `--spec-format`: (Optional) Specify the desired OpenAPI specification format. Defaults to `yaml`. Values: `yaml` or `json`.

**Example Configuration File (your-cli-tool.config):**

```yaml
openapi_plan:
  project_path: ./my_api_project
  language: python
  framework: fastapi
  output_file: openapi_implementation.md
  api_discovery: true
  spec_format: json
```

You can then run the command without specifying the options on the command line:

```bash
your-cli-tool generate-openapi-plan
```

**Installation/Setup:**

No additional installation or setup is required beyond the standard installation of `your-cli-tool`. Ensure you have the latest version installed to access this feature.  You can update your installation using:

```bash
pip install --upgrade your-cli-tool
```

or the appropriate package manager for your system.
