## Automated Implementation Plan for User Updates (UPDATE Operation)

This feature automates the generation of an implementation plan for adding the `UPDATE` operation for user data. It streamlines the process of modifying existing user information by providing a structured plan outlining the necessary steps, dependencies, and potential risks. This automation significantly reduces the time and effort required for implementing user updates, ensuring consistency and minimizing errors.

**Key Benefits:**

*   **Accelerated Development:** Quickly generate a comprehensive implementation plan, speeding up the development lifecycle.
*   **Reduced Errors:** Standardized plan format minimizes the risk of overlooking critical steps or introducing inconsistencies.
*   **Improved Collaboration:** Provides a clear and structured document for team members to understand and contribute to the implementation process.
*   **Enhanced Traceability:**  Allows for easy tracking of progress and identification of potential bottlenecks.

### Usage Examples

To generate an implementation plan for adding the `UPDATE` operation for users, use the following command (example assumes a command-line interface):

```bash
./implementation_plan_generator.py --entity user --operation update --output user_update_plan.md
```

This command will:

1.  Execute the `implementation_plan_generator.py` script.
2.  Specify that the plan should be generated for the `user` entity.
3.  Indicate that the desired operation is `update`.
4.  Save the generated implementation plan to a file named `user_update_plan.md`.

**Example Output (Snippet from `user_update_plan.md`):**

```markdown
## Implementation Plan: User Update Operation

**Entity:** User
**Operation:** Update

### 1. Requirements Analysis

*   [ ] Define the user attributes that can be updated.
*   [ ] Determine the validation rules for each updatable attribute.
*   [ ] Identify any dependencies on other services or modules.

### 2. Database Schema Updates

*   [ ] Review the existing user table schema.
*   [ ] Identify any necessary schema modifications to support updates (e.g., adding audit columns).
*   [ ] Create a database migration script for schema updates.

### Configuration Options

The `implementation_plan_generator.py` script (or equivalent) supports the following configuration options:

| Option                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | Default Value | Example                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--entity`            | Specifies the entity for which the implementation plan is generated.                                                                                                                                | `None`        | `--entity user`                                              |
| `--operation`         | Specifies the operation to be implemented.  Currently supports `update`.                                                                                                                             | `None`        | `--operation update`                                         |
| `--output`            | Specifies the output file path for the generated implementation plan.                                                                                                                                | `implementation_plan.md` | `--output user_update_plan.md`                              |
| `--template`          | (Optional) Specifies a custom template file to use for generating the implementation plan.  This allows for customization of the plan structure and content.                                        | `default.md`  | `--template custom_update_template.md`                      |
| `--include-security` | (Optional) Includes security-related tasks in the generated implementation plan (e.g., access control, data sanitization).  Defaults to `True`.                                                         | `True`        | `--include-security False`                                  |
