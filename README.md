## Automated Implementation Plan for Add LIST Operation for Orders

This feature automates the creation of an implementation plan when adding a `LIST` operation for orders to your system.  It analyzes your existing order data structures and provides a suggested implementation path, including API endpoint suggestions, database query examples, and code snippets to get you started quickly. This helps streamline development, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across your order management system.

**Usage Examples:**

Assuming you have integrated the automated implementation plan tool into your CLI or UI:

*   **CLI Example:**

    ```bash
    ./order-implementation-tool --operation LIST --entity order
    ```

    This command will analyze your order data and generate a suggested implementation plan in the console.  You can then redirect the output to a file for further review.

    ```bash
    ./order-implementation-tool --operation LIST --entity order > order_list_implementation_plan.txt
    ```

*   **UI Example:**

    Within the Order Management section of your UI, select "Add Operation -> LIST." The system will then prompt you to confirm that you want to generate an automated implementation plan.  Click "Generate Plan" to view the suggested implementation details.  The UI will display the API endpoint, database query, and code snippet suggestions.

**Output:**

The tool will generate a detailed plan, including:

*   **API Endpoint Suggestion:** `/orders` (for retrieving all orders) or `/orders?status={status}` (for filtering)
*   **Database Query Example (PostgreSQL):** `SELECT * FROM orders;` or `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = $1;`
*   **Code Snippet Example (Python):**

    ```python
    def list_orders(status=None):
        # Connect to the database
        conn = psycopg2.connect(...)
        cur = conn.cursor()

        if status:
            cur.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = %s;", (status,))
        else:
            cur.execute("SELECT * FROM orders;")

        orders = cur.fetchall()
        conn.close()
        return orders
    ```

**New Configuration Options:**

This feature introduces the following configuration options, typically located in a configuration file (e.g., `config.ini` or `application.yml`):

*   `implementation_plan.database_type`: Specifies the type of database used (e.g., `postgresql`, `mysql`, `sqlite`).  Defaults to `postgresql`.
    ```ini
    [implementation_plan]
    database_type = postgresql
    ```
*   `implementation_plan.api_base_path`: Specifies the base path for your order API.  Defaults to `/api/v1`.
    ```ini
    [implementation_plan]
    api_base_path = /api/v1
    ```
*   `implementation_plan.preferred_language`:  Specifies the preferred programming language for code snippet generation (e.g., `python`, `java`, `javascript`). Defaults to `python`.
    ```ini
    [implementation_plan]
    preferred_language = python
    ```

**Installation/Setup Instructions:**

No specific installation or setup is required beyond ensuring the core application dependencies are met. This feature is integrated directly into the `order-implementation-tool` executable. Ensure that the configuration file (e.g., `config.ini` or `application.yml`) is properly configured with the database connection details and other settings mentioned above.  Refer to the main application documentation for details on configuring the overall application environment.
