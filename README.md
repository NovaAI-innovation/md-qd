## Automated Implementation Plan for OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation

This feature automates the creation of an implementation plan for adding OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to your project. By analyzing your codebase, it identifies potential endpoints and suggests a structured approach to documenting them, saving you time and effort in the initial planning stages. It generates a prioritized list of endpoints, suggests relevant documentation approaches based on your project type, and estimates the effort involved.

**Key Benefits:**

*   **Accelerated Onboarding:** Quickly get started with documenting your APIs.
*   **Reduced Manual Effort:** Automate the initial planning and prioritization process.
*   **Improved Consistency:** Ensure a consistent approach to API documentation across your project.
*   **Clear Roadmap:** Provides a structured plan for documenting your APIs.

### Usage Examples

After installing the feature (see installation section below), you can generate an implementation plan using the following command:

```bash
your-project-tool generate-openapi-plan --project-path ./your-project
```

This command analyzes the project located at `./your-project` and generates a detailed implementation plan.  The plan will be outputted to the console by default.

To save the plan to a file, use the `--output` option:

```bash
your-project-tool generate-openapi-plan --project-path ./your-project --output openapi_plan.md
```

This will save the generated implementation plan to a Markdown file named `openapi_plan.md`.

To specify a configuration file (see configuration options below), use the `--config` option:

```bash
your-project-tool generate-openapi-plan --project-path ./your-project --config openapi_config.yaml
```

This will use the configuration file `openapi_config.yaml` to customize the plan generation process.

### Configuration Options

The behavior of the implementation plan generator can be customized using a configuration file (YAML format).  Here are the available options:

*   **`endpoint_discovery.include_patterns`**: (Optional, List of strings) A list of regular expressions used to identify potential API endpoints.  Defaults to commonly used route patterns. Example: `["/api/.*", "/v[0-9]+/.*"]`
*   **`endpoint_discovery.exclude_patterns`**: (Optional, List of strings) A list of regular expressions used to exclude specific paths from being considered as API endpoints. Example: `["/healthcheck", "/metrics"]`
*   **`documentation.format`**: (Optional, String)  The desired documentation format.  Supported values are `swagger` and `openapi`. Defaults to `openapi`.
*   **`effort_estimation.complexity_multiplier`**: (Optional, Float) A multiplier used to adjust the estimated effort based on the perceived complexity of the project. Defaults to `1.0`.
*   **`output.format`**: (Optional, String) The format of the output file. Supported values are `markdown` and `json`. Defaults to `markdown`.

**Example `openapi_config.yaml`:**

```yaml
endpoint_discovery:
  exclude_patterns:
    - "/admin/.*"

documentation:
  format: swagger

effort_estimation:
  complexity_multiplier: 1.2
```

### Installation/Setup Instructions

This feature is included as part of the core `your-project-tool` package. Ensure you have the latest version installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade your-project-tool
```

No further setup is required.  The `generate-openapi-plan` command will then be available.
