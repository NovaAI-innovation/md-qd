## Automated Implementation Plan for OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation

This feature automates the creation of an implementation plan for adding OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to your project. It analyzes your existing codebase and generates a prioritized list of tasks, including identifying endpoints, defining schemas, and adding descriptions. This helps streamline the process of documenting your API and ensures a consistent and complete specification.

**Usage Examples:**

To generate an implementation plan, use the following command:

```bash
your-tool generate-openapi-plan --source-dir ./your-api-source --output-file openapi_implementation_plan.md
```

This command will analyze the code in the `./your-api-source` directory and generate a Markdown file named `openapi_implementation_plan.md` containing the implementation plan.

You can also specify a configuration file to customize the analysis and generation process:

```bash
your-tool generate-openapi-plan --config config.yaml --source-dir ./your-api-source --output-file openapi_implementation_plan.md
```

**Configuration Options:**

The following configuration options are available in the `config.yaml` file (or passed as command-line arguments):

*   **`source_dir` (required):** The directory containing your API source code.
    *   Type: `string`
    *   Example: `./your-api-source`
*   **`output_file` (optional):** The path to the output Markdown file. Defaults to `openapi_implementation_plan.md` in the current directory.
    *   Type: `string`
    *   Example: `docs/openapi_plan.md`
*   **`language` (optional):** The programming language of your API.  If not specified, the tool will attempt to auto-detect the language. Supported languages: `python`, `java`, `javascript`.
    *   Type: `string`
    *   Example: `python`
*   **`endpoint_patterns` (optional):** A list of regular expressions used to identify API endpoints in your code.  If not specified, default patterns for the detected language will be used.  This allows you to customize how endpoints are detected based on your framework or coding style.
    *   Type: `list[string]`
    *   Example: `['@route\("(.*)"\)', 'path = "(.*)"']`
*   **`exclude_files` (optional):** A list of file paths or patterns to exclude from analysis.
    *   Type: `list[string]`
    *   Example: `['tests/*', '**/legacy_code.py']`
*   **`include_paths` (optional):** A list of specific paths to include in the analysis, overriding the `exclude_files`.
    *   Type: `list[string]`
    *   Example: `['api/v2']`
*   **`prioritization_rules` (optional):** A list of rules to customize the prioritization of tasks. This allows you to prioritize tasks based on factors such as endpoint popularity or complexity.  (See the Advanced Configuration section for more details).
    *   Type: `list[object]`
    *   Example: See Advanced Configuration.

**Example `config.yaml`:**

```yaml
source_dir: ./my_api
output_file: api_plan.md
language: python
exclude_files:
  - tests/*
endpoint_patterns:
  - "@route\('(.*)'\)"
```

**Installation/Setup:**

This feature is included with the latest version of `your-tool`.  Ensure you have the latest version installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade your-tool
```

No additional setup is required.  Once installed, you can use the `generate-openapi-plan` command as described above.
