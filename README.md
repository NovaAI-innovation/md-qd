## Automated Implementation Plan for Add LIST Operation for Orders

This feature introduces an automated implementation plan to simplify the process of adding a `LIST` operation (fetching multiple orders) to your order management system.  Instead of manually coding the necessary components, this feature provides a guided, semi-automated process that generates the boilerplate code, database queries, and API endpoints required for a functional `LIST` operation. This significantly reduces development time and ensures consistency across your order API.

**Description:**

The automated implementation plan streamlines the creation of a `LIST` operation for retrieving multiple order records. It helps you:

*   Generate the necessary controller logic.
*   Create data access objects (DAOs) for database interaction.
*   Define API endpoints for accessing the `LIST` functionality.
*   Set up pagination and filtering options for efficient data retrieval.

**Usage Examples:**

1.  **Initiating the Implementation Plan:**

    From your project's root directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./manage_orders.sh implement_list --entity order --namespace OrderManagement
    ```

    This command initiates the automated plan to add a `LIST` operation for the `order` entity within the `OrderManagement` namespace.

2.  **Customizing Pagination:**

    To specify a default page size of 50, use the `--page-size` option:

    ```bash
    ./manage_orders.sh implement_list --entity order --namespace OrderManagement --page-size 50
    ```

3.  **Adding Filtering Capabilities:**

    To enable filtering by order status, use the `--filter-fields` option:

    ```bash
    ./manage_orders.sh implement_list --entity order --namespace OrderManagement --filter-fields status,customer_id
    ```

    This command will add filtering capabilities for the `status` and `customer_id` fields. The filtering will be implemented using standard database query practices (e.g., `WHERE status = ? AND customer_id = ?`).

4.  **Reviewing and Applying Changes:**

    The implementation plan will generate a set of code files with comments indicating the areas that may require further customization and review.  Carefully examine these files before deploying them to a production environment.

**Configuration Options:**

The `implement_list` command supports the following configuration options:

*   `--entity <entity_name>`:  (Required) The name of the entity for which to generate the `LIST` operation (e.g., `order`, `invoice`).
*   `--namespace <namespace>`: (Required) The namespace for the generated code (e.g., `OrderManagement`, `Billing`).
*   `--page-size <integer>`: (Optional) The default number of items to return per page. Defaults to 25 if not specified.
*   `--filter-fields <field1,field2,...>`: (Optional) A comma-separated list of fields to enable filtering on.  These fields must exist as columns in the entity's database table.
*   `--sortable-fields <field1,field2,...>`: (Optional) A comma-separated list of fields that can be used for sorting the results.  If not specified, no sorting will be enabled.
*   `--output-dir <path>`: (Optional) The directory where the generated code will be placed.  Defaults to the project's source code directory if not specified.

**Installation/Setup:**

This feature is included as part of the core order management tool suite. To ensure proper functionality, verify that:

1.  The `manage_orders.sh` script is executable. You may need to run `chmod +x manage_orders.sh`.
2.  Your database connection is properly configured in the application's configuration file.
3.  The database schema for the specified entity (`--entity`) exists.

No additional installation steps are required.  The feature is ready to use after ensuring the above prerequisites are met.
