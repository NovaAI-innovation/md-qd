## Automated Implementation Plan for OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation

This feature automates the generation of an implementation plan for adding OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to your project. It analyzes your existing codebase and identifies potential endpoints, data structures, and authentication methods. Based on this analysis, it creates a prioritized list of tasks with estimated effort, dependencies, and suggested approaches for documenting your API. This helps streamline the documentation process and ensures comprehensive API coverage.

**Key Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Time and Effort:** Automates the initial planning phase, saving significant time and effort in manually identifying and prioritizing documentation tasks.
*   **Improved API Coverage:** Ensures all relevant API endpoints and data structures are considered for documentation.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Provides a clear and structured plan for documenting the API, facilitating collaboration among developers and technical writers.
*   **Consistent Documentation:** Promotes a consistent approach to API documentation across the project.

### Usage Examples

**1. Generating a Plan for the Entire Project:**

From the root directory of your project, run the following command:

```bash
your-cli-tool generate-openapi-plan --output plan.md
```

This will analyze your entire project and generate an implementation plan saved in `plan.md`.

**2. Generating a Plan for a Specific Module:**

To focus on a specific module or directory, specify the path:

```bash
your-cli-tool generate-openapi-plan --path /path/to/your/module --output module_plan.md
```

This will generate a plan specifically for the files within `/path/to/your/module` and save it to `module_plan.md`.

**3. Using a Configuration File:**

You can customize the behavior of the plan generator using a configuration file (e.g., `openapi_config.yaml`):

```bash
your-cli-tool generate-openapi-plan --config openapi_config.yaml --output customized_plan.md
```

This allows you to specify options like ignored files, preferred documentation format, and custom analysis rules.  See the "Configuration Options" section for details on the available options.

### Configuration Options

The `generate-openapi-plan` feature supports the following configuration options, which can be specified in a YAML or JSON configuration file:

*   **`ignore_files` (list of strings, optional):**  A list of file paths or glob patterns to exclude from analysis.  Useful for excluding test files, generated code, or irrelevant modules.  Example: `["**/tests/**", "**/generated/**"]`
*   **`preferred_format` (string, optional):**  The preferred documentation format (e.g., "Swagger 2.0", "OpenAPI 3.0").  Defaults to "OpenAPI 3.0".
*   **`authentication_methods` (list of strings, optional):** A list of authentication methods to prioritize during the plan generation (e.g., "OAuth2", "API Key"). The plan will try to detect the authentication methods in use, but you can manually specify them for more accurate planning.
*   **`max_endpoints_per_task` (integer, optional):**  The maximum number of endpoints to include in a single documentation task.  Defaults to 5.
*   **`enable_suggestions` (boolean, optional):**  Enables or disables the generation of suggested documentation approaches within the plan. Defaults to `true`.
*   **`custom_rules` (list of objects, optional):** A list of custom analysis rules, allowing you to tailor the plan generation to your specific project requirements.  The format of these rules is beyond the scope of this document; see the advanced configuration guide for details.

**Example Configuration File (openapi_config.yaml):**

```yaml
ignore_files:
  - "**/tests/**"
  - "legacy_code.py"
preferred_format: "OpenAPI 3.0"
authentication_methods:
  - "OAuth2"
max_endpoints_per_task: 3
enable_suggestions: true
```

### Installation/Setup

This feature is included with the core installation of `your-cli-tool`. No additional installation or setup is required. Ensure you have the latest version of `your-cli-tool` installed to benefit from the most recent enhancements and bug fixes. You can update `your-cli-tool` using your preferred package manager (e.g., `pip install --upgrade your-cli-tool`).
