## Automated Implementation Plan for User Update (UPDATE Operation)

This feature introduces an automated implementation plan for adding the `UPDATE` operation for user management. It streamlines the process of modifying existing user data by automatically generating the necessary code structure, including database interactions, API endpoints, and validation logic. This significantly reduces development time and ensures consistency across your user management system.

**Usage Examples:**

Let's assume you have a user management system already set up. To utilize the automated implementation plan for the `UPDATE` operation, you would typically use a command-line interface (CLI) or a dedicated tool integrated into your development environment.

**Example (CLI Scenario):**

```bash
# Assumes a hypothetical CLI command called 'user-manager'
user-manager generate update --user_id --first_name --last_name --email --role
```

This command would analyze your existing user model and database schema, and then generate the following:

*   **Database Update Function:**  A function to update user data in the database based on the provided `user_id`.
*   **API Endpoint (e.g., `/users/{user_id}` with PUT method):**  An endpoint for receiving update requests.
*   **Request Validation:**  Code to validate the incoming data (e.g., email format, required fields).
*   **Response Handling:**  Code to handle successful updates or errors.

After the code is generated, you'll need to review it, potentially customize it to fit your specific business logic, and then integrate it into your application.

**Example (Code Snippet - Generated API Endpoint):**

```python
# (Hypothetical example using Flask)
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_user(user_id):
    data = request.get_json()

    # Generated validation logic (example)
    if not data.get('email'):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Email is required'}), 400

    # Generated database update function (example)
    try:
        update_user_in_database(user_id, data)
        return jsonify({'message': 'User updated successfully'}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Configuration Options:**

This feature utilizes a configuration file (e.g., `user_manager.config`) to define settings such as database connection details, naming conventions, and default validation rules.  Here are some key configuration options:

*   **`database.type`:**  Specifies the database type (e.g., `mysql`, `postgresql`, `sqlite`).  Default: `sqlite`.
*   **`database.connection_string`:**  The connection string for your database.  Example: `mysql://user:password@host/database`.
*   **`api.endpoint_prefix`:**  A prefix to apply to all generated API endpoints.  Default: `/api/v1`.
*   **`validation.email_regex`:**  A regular expression used for validating email addresses.  Default: (A standard email regex).  You can customize this to enforce stricter or more lenient validation.
*   **`code_generation.language`:** Specifies the programming language for generated code. Supported values: `python`, `javascript`. Default: `python`.
*   **`code_generation.framework`:** Specifies the framework for generated code. Supported values: `flask`, `express`. Default: `flask`.

You can modify these options in the `user_manager.config` file located in the project's root directory.

**Installation/Setup:**

No specific installation is required beyond the standard setup for your user management system. The automated implementation plan is integrated as a module/component. Ensure that the `user-manager` CLI tool (or equivalent) is installed and properly configured.

**Example (Python - pip installation):**

```bash
pip install user-manager
```

Refer to the main documentation for detailed instructions on installing and configuring the `user-manager` tool and any dependencies it might require.  Ensure that your environment is properly set up with the necessary database drivers and API framework dependencies.
