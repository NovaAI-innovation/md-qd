## Automated Implementation Plan for User Updates (UPDATE Operation)

This feature automates the creation of an implementation plan for adding the `UPDATE` operation for users. It analyzes your existing user management infrastructure, identifies required changes, and generates a detailed plan outlining the steps needed to implement the `UPDATE` functionality. This plan includes database schema modifications (if necessary), API endpoint creation, security considerations, and testing strategies, ultimately reducing the time and effort required for implementing user updates.

**Usage Examples:**

Assuming you have the `user-management-tool` command-line interface (CLI) installed, you can generate the implementation plan using the following command:

```bash
user-management-tool plan generate update --user-model User --database postgres --auth-method oauth2
```

This command will generate a plan for adding the `UPDATE` operation to the `User` model, assuming a PostgreSQL database and OAuth2 authentication.  The generated plan will be output to the console and can also be saved to a file:

```bash
user-management-tool plan generate update --user-model User --database mysql --auth-method jwt --output update_implementation_plan.md
```

This command will generate a plan for a `User` model with a MySQL database and JWT authentication, saving the output to a file named `update_implementation_plan.md`.

You can also view a summary of the available options with the `--help` flag:

```bash
user-management-tool plan generate update --help
```

This will display a help message outlining all available command-line options.

**Configuration Options:**

The `plan generate update` command supports the following configuration options:

*   `--user-model <model_name>`:  (Required) Specifies the name of the User model.  This is used to understand the existing data structure and identify fields that can be updated.
*   `--database <database_type>`: (Required) Specifies the type of database being used (e.g., `postgres`, `mysql`, `mongodb`). This allows the tool to generate database-specific schema update scripts.
*   `--auth-method <authentication_type>`: (Required) Specifies the authentication method used (e.g., `oauth2`, `jwt`, `basic`).  This is used to determine the appropriate authorization checks to implement for the `UPDATE` operation.
*   `--output <filename>`: (Optional) Specifies the filename to save the generated implementation plan to. If not specified, the plan will be printed to the console.
*   `--id-field <field_name>`: (Optional) Specifies the field name used as the unique identifier for users (e.g., `user_id`, `id`, `uuid`). Defaults to `id` if not specified.
*   `--exclude-fields <field1,field2,...>`: (Optional) Specifies a comma-separated list of fields that should *not* be updatable. This can be used to prevent modification of sensitive fields like `password` or `created_at` directly through the `UPDATE` endpoint.

**Installation/Setup:**

This feature is included as part of the `user-management-tool` CLI.  Ensure you have the latest version of the tool installed to access this functionality.  Refer to the main documentation for instructions on installing and configuring the `user-management-tool`. No additional setup is required specifically for the automated implementation plan feature.
