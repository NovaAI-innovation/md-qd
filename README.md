## Automated Implementation Plan for Add LIST Operation for Orders

This feature automates the implementation plan for adding a `LIST` operation to the Orders service.  It significantly reduces the manual effort required to define and execute the necessary steps for exposing a list of orders, streamlining development and ensuring consistency across implementations. This automated plan generates the required code skeletons, database schema updates (if applicable), and API endpoint definitions, allowing developers to focus on the business logic and specific filtering/sorting requirements.

**Description:**

The Automated Implementation Plan generates a pre-defined, best-practice-based plan for adding a `LIST` operation to the Orders service. This includes:

*   **Code Generation:** Creation of controller methods, service layer functions, and data access layer queries/functions.
*   **API Definition:** Definition of the API endpoint (e.g., `/orders`) with appropriate request parameters (e.g., pagination, filtering, sorting).
*   **Database Schema Updates (Optional):** Generates suggestions for optimized database queries based on common filtering needs.  This step requires manual review and confirmation before execution.
*   **Testing Framework:** Creates basic unit and integration tests to ensure the `LIST` operation functions correctly.

**Usage Examples:**

1.  **Initiating the Automated Plan:**

    Assuming you have the necessary tooling installed (see Installation/Setup below), you can initiate the automated plan using the following command-line interface (CLI):

    ```bash
    order-service-cli implement-list-orders --endpoint /orders --page-size 25 --default-sort order_date:desc
    ```

    *   `order-service-cli`:  The command-line interface for the Orders service.
    *   `implement-list-orders`:  The command indicating the automated implementation plan for the LIST operation.
    *   `--endpoint /orders`: Specifies the API endpoint for listing orders.
    *   `--page-size 25`: Sets the default page size to 25 orders per page.
    *   `--default-sort order_date:desc`: Defines the default sorting order as `order_date` in descending order.

2.  **Reviewing the Generated Plan:**

    The CLI will output a detailed plan outlining all the proposed changes. Carefully review each step before proceeding. The plan will typically include:

    *   **Code modifications:**  Location of files to be modified and the suggested code additions.
    *   **Database schema changes:**  SQL scripts for database updates (if applicable).
    *   **API endpoint definition:**  A snippet defining the API endpoint in your API gateway or framework.
    *   **Test case skeletons:**  Empty test cases for you to populate with specific test scenarios.

3.  **Executing the Plan:**

    After reviewing and approving the plan, you can execute it using the `--execute` flag:

    ```bash
    order-service-cli implement-list-orders --endpoint /orders --page-size 25 --default-sort order_date:desc --execute
    ```

    **Warning:** The `--execute` flag will automatically apply the code changes and database schema updates (if confirmed).  Ensure you have a backup of your codebase and database before executing the plan.

**Configuration Options:**

The following configuration options are available for the `implement-list-orders` command:

| Option                  | Description                                                                                                                                  | Default Value |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--endpoint`            | The API endpoint for listing orders.                                                                                                        | `/orders`     |
| `--page-size`           | The default number of orders to return per page.                                                                                             | `10`          |
| `--max-page-size`       | The maximum number of orders allowed per page.  This prevents abuse by clients requesting extremely large pages.                               | `100`         |
| `--default-sort`        | The default sorting order.  Specify the field and direction (e.g., `order_date:desc`, `customer_id:asc`).                                     | `order_id:asc`|
| `--allowed-sort-fields` | A comma-separated list of fields that are allowed for sorting.  This restricts clients from sorting by arbitrary fields for security reasons. |  (All fields allowed if not specified) |
| `--enable-filtering`   | Enables filtering functionality.  If enabled, the plan will generate code to handle filtering based on query parameters.                      | `true`        |
| `--execute`             | Automatically executes the generated plan.  Use with caution!                                                                                | `false`       |
| `--dry-run`             |  Prints the plan without executing any changes. This is the default behavior if `--execute` is not specified.                                | `true`        |

**Installation/Setup:**

1.  **Install the `order-service-cli`:**

    The automated implementation plan is accessed through the `order-service-cli`.  Install it using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    npm install -g order-service-cli  # For Node.js projects
    # OR
    pip install order-service-cli     # For Python projects
    ```

2.  **Configure Database Connection (if applicable):**

    If your `LIST` operation requires database access, configure the database connection settings in the `order-service-cli` configuration file (typically located at `~/.order-service-cli/config.json`).  The configuration file should include the following information:

    ```json
    {
      "database": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5432,
        "database": "orders_db",
        "user": "order_user",
        "password": "your_password"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Note:**  Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials.

3.  **Verify Installation:**

    Verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    order-service-cli --version
    ```

    This should print the version number of the `order-service-cli`.

With these steps completed, you are now ready to use the Automated Implementation Plan for adding a `LIST` operation to your Orders service. Remember to carefully review the generated plan before execution to ensure it aligns with your specific requirements and coding standards.
