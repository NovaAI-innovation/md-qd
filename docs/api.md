# API Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about our API, including endpoints, parameters, responses, and authentication requirements.  We use OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation, ensuring clarity and ease of use.

## Overview

This API provides access to [Briefly describe the functionality of your API here.  E.g., "manage user accounts, process payments, and retrieve product information"].

## Authentication

[Describe the authentication method used.  If no authentication is required, state that.  Examples include:

*   **API Key:**  Include the `X-API-Key` header in all requests.  You can obtain an API key from [Link to registration/settings page].
*   **OAuth 2.0:**  Use the `Authorization` header with a bearer token.  See the [OAuth 2.0 documentation](link_to_oauth_docs) for details on obtaining tokens.
*   **Basic Authentication:** Use the `Authorization` header with the `Basic` scheme.  `Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded username:password>`.  This method is **not recommended** for production environments.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  This API does not require authentication.
]

**Example (API Key):**

```
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.example.com/users
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clear Structure:** Uses a clear Markdown structure with headings and subheadings for easy navigation.
* **Comprehensive Endpoint Documentation:**  Each endpoint includes:
    *   Endpoint URL
    *   Description of the functionality
    *   Detailed parameter tables, specifying name, type, location (`in`), whether it's required, and a description.
    *   Response codes and descriptions for common scenarios (success, errors).
    *   Example JSON responses for each response code.
    *   Example `curl` requests to demonstrate how to call the API.
* **Authentication Section:**  Provides a dedicated section for authentication, explaining the method used and providing examples. *Crucially*, it handles the case where *no* authentication is required.
* **Error Code Table:**  Includes a table summarizing common error codes and their meanings.  This is extremely helpful for developers debugging issues.
* **Example Requests with `curl`:** The `curl` examples are essential for quickly testing the API. They include the necessary headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, `X-API-Key`).
* **Realistic Examples:** The examples use realistic data and scenarios.
* **Clear Error Messages:** The error responses include helpful error messages to aid in debugging.
* **Content-Type Header:**  The `Content-Type: application/json` header is included in `POST` requests to specify the format of the request body.
* **Link to Swagger/OpenAPI Specification:** Provides a link to the full OpenAPI/Swagger specification file, allowing developers to use tools to generate client code or explore the API interactively.
* **DELETE Method Example:**  Added an example for the `DELETE` method, which is often overlooked in API documentation.
* **Forbidden (403) Error:** Added a 403 Forbidden error with an example response.  This is important for APIs with permission control.
* **Contributing Section:**  Added a section for information on contributing to the API or documentation.
* **More Realistic Error Messages:** Improved error message examples to be more informative.
* **Path Parameters:** Correctly identifies path parameters.
* **Completeness:** Covers GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
* **Placeholders:** Includes placeholders (e.g., `[Link to registration/settings page]`, `YOUR_API_KEY`) that you *must* replace with actual values.
* **Improved Formatting:** Better Markdown formatting for readability.

**How to use this documentation:**

1.  **Replace Placeholders:**  Carefully replace all the bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Link to your Swagger UI...]`, `YOUR_API_KEY`) with the actual values for your API.
2.  **Adapt to Your API:** This is a template.  You *must* modify it to accurately reflect the endpoints, parameters, responses, and authentication methods of *your* specific API.  Add more endpoints as needed.
3.  **Generate from OpenAPI/Swagger:**  Ideally, generate this documentation (or at least the core endpoint details) automatically from your OpenAPI/Swagger specification file.  Tools like Swagger UI, Redoc, and others can render your specification into a human-readable format.
4.  **Keep it Up-to-Date:**  API documentation is only useful if it's accurate.  Make sure to update the documentation whenever you change your API.  Automated generation from the OpenAPI/Swagger specification is the best way to ensure this.
5.  **Consider API Reference Tools:**  Look into specialized API reference documentation tools. They often provide features like interactive examples, code generation, and easier maintenance of documentation.

This improved response provides a much more complete and useful API documentation template.  Remember to customize it thoroughly for your specific API.
